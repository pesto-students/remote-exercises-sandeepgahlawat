**Power Set**
Power set of a set A is the set of all of the subsets of A.
Eg. for {x, y, z}, the subsets are : {{}, {x}, {y}, {z}, {x, y}, {x, z}, {y, z}, {x, y, z}}

Write an iterable that generates all power sets of a set. Your input is going be a
JavaScript `Set`, and not an `Array`.

Your return value has to be a `Set` as well.

## Restrictions
- Don't use any external libraries.
